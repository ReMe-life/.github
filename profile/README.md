ReMeLife &amp; Lumi Project Description

Lumi is the most recent development within the growing ReMeLife care ecosystem. A suite of seven AI functions, Lumi serves both the needs of ReMeLife's users and those of the ecosystem itself, from personal agents to systems management.

ReMeLife is the world's first crypto rewards-based person-centric health and social care community, that, as a pioneering social impact business, uses the power of crypto and decentralised communities to leverage, democratise and share the value inherent in digital care work, and that captures and monetises its proprietary ELR (Electronic Life Records) personal data set for the benefit of its community Members. The free app ecosystem, with its RemindMecare person-centred activities based care app at its heart, enables both consumers and businesses to not only care for their family and/or clients but also to build a ‘care2earn’ passively derived income. 

The earned or purchased regulatory compliant LUMI and REME utility tokens, deployed on our own POA ReMeChain, possesses little energy overhead or transactional gas costs.  ReMeLife shares its wealth with its Members, through a smart contract managed Member governed DAO. 

Future products planned will include ReMeLife’s ‘CareFI’ version of DeFi, in which community Members can plan for their future financial needs. ReMeLife’s ecosystem of opportunity for its community (including its coming soon utility NFT’s, and charity launchpad) is creating a 'Careocracy', one that’s intended to bring 'sharing to caring’ and 'community into care'. And importantly, it brings future tech to those that are often excluded. 

Lumi makes care giving rewarded, more fun, and less burdensome for those in the frontline of care.
